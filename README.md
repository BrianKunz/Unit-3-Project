# Unit-3-Project
## Description

Welcome to our Github repo! This project is designed to revolutionize that way people find gifts for those that are hard to shop for! Our application is built with the focus of an easy to use interface and allow users to access listings for that perfect item from a link supplied by the creator. Users can create items and lists based on categories to help the next person not have to scoure the internet for that great gift!

Here is our application in action:
