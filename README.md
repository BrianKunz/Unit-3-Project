# Unit-3-Project
## Description

Welcome to our Github repo! This project is designed to revolutionize that way people find gifts for those that are hard to shop for! Our application is built with the focus of an easy to use interface and allow users to access listings for that perfect item from a link supplied by the creator. Users can create items and lists based on categories to help the next person not have to scoure the internet for that great gift!

Here is our application in action:


As you can see, our application is user friendly and easy on the eyes. This application really will help making gift hunting that much easier.

Feel free to explore our repo, ask questions, and provide suggestions! We love you

## Unsolved Issues
We had trouble connecting the front end with the back end, We have a login and signup page that show and take data push it to the db but it cant pull that data back to move to the next page. We can create,delete,edit on the back end.

## Future Enhancments
In the future we hope to have more list's available to consumers from our catagories;as well as the abilty to click to share lists and items to anyone using any traditional shareing way. Whether that would be on socials, email, text, ect. A ranking system for our lists would also be an interesting feature to show highest rated to lowest rated.
